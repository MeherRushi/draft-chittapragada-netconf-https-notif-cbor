1.  Introduction

   RFCXXXX [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif-15] introduces a
   framework for the transfer of YANG notifications over HTTPS using
   JSON and XML encoding schemes.  This document extends RFCXXXX
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif-15] by introducing CBOR encoding
   for event notifications over HTTPS in addition to the existing
   encoding schemes.

   In RFCXXXX, the capabilities HTTP-target resource allows a publisher
   to retrieve supported encoding formats via a GET request, while the
   relay-notification resource enables the publisher to send YANG
   notifications via POST requests.  These requests and responses use
   different content types based on the selected encoding scheme.

   CBOR offers a more efficient and compact representation of YANG
   notifications.

   This document provides description and examples of the GET and POST
   request and reply encoded in CBOR

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms defined in Section 2,3 and 4
   of RFCXXXX [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif-15]:

   *  Capabilities Resource

   *  Relay-Notification

   *  Event Notification

   The following term(s) are defined in Subscription to YANG
   Notifications [RFC8639]:

   *  Publisher

   *  Receiver

   *  Subscribed Notifications

4.  CBOR Encoding

   YANG notifications can be encoded in CBOR using Names or SIDs in
   keys.  Notifications encoded using names is similar to JSON encoding
   as defined in Section 3.4 and 4.3 of RFCXXXX
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif-15].  Notification encoded using
   YANG-SIDs replaces the names of the keys of the CBOR encoded message
   for a 63 bit unsigned integer.  In this case, the keys of the encoded
   data use the SID value as defined in Section 3.2 of [RFC9254].

4.1.  Request

   The publisher sends a request to the receiver to learn its
   capabilities.  In the below example, the “Accept” states that the
   publisher wants to receive the capabilities response in CBOR but if
   not supported then in XML or JSON in that order.

   GET /some/path/capabilities HTTP/1.1

   Host: example.com

   Accept: application/cbor, application/xml;0.9, application/json;q=0.5

4.2.  Response

   If the receiver is able to reply using “application/cbor” and
   assuming it is capable of receiving JSON, XML and CBOR encoded
   messages the response would look like this

4.2.1.  CBOR using names as keys

   Diagnostic Notation:

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Date: Tue, 4 March 2025 20:33:30 GMT
      Server: example-server
      Cache-Control: no-cache
      Content-Type: application/json
      {
      "receiver-capabilities": {
        "receiver-capability": [
          "urn:ietf:capability:https-notif-receiver:encoding:json",
          "urn:ietf:capability:https-notif-receiver:encoding:xml",
          "urn:ietf:capability:https-notif-receiver:encoding:cbor"
           ]
         }
      }

5.  Security Considerations

   Addition of the CBOR encoding introduces no specific security
   exposures or risks other that the ones mentioned in [RFC9254] and RFC
   XXXX [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif-15] (An HTTPS-based
   Transport for YANG Notifications)

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
